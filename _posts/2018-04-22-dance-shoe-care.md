So, you just bought your first pair of ballroom dance shoes, that's Awesome! Dance shoes make a huge difference in the way you're able to move
on the dance floor. Below are a few tips that may not be obvious about maintaining your shoes:


* The bottom of the shoe is Suede, so it is highly vulnerable to getting wet and affecting the coefficient of friction of the shoe
* For the above reason, don't wear these shoes outside, and be careful when visiting the bathroom to avoid stepping in any water
* After dancing on the shoes for a time, the Suede will become packed down, and slick to dance on. There are metal [bristled brushes](http://www.danceshoesstore.com/FoldableShoeBrush), available online and sometimes in dance studios that can be used to restore some of the Suede's friction. I brush toward the toe of the shoe. Don't brush too vigorously, just enough to remove the top layer of dust and dirt to give you a little more grip on the dance floor.
* Depending on where you store your shoes while not wearing them, they may become squashed by other things. I recommend a [shoe tree](https://smile.amazon.com/Woodlore-Adjustable-Mens-Shoe-Tree/dp/B002VWKREO?sa-no-redirect=1) when this happens. It'll the shoe keep some of its shape when you're not wearing it.
