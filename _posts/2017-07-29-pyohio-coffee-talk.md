[Henner Zeller's repo](https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix#controlling-rgb-led-display-with-raspberry-pi-gpio) containing all wiring diagrams and Python C-bindings to render drawings and pixels on the LED panel.

[My Repo](https://github.com/yanigisawa/coffee-scale) with all of the python code I wrote to read the scale and render animations to the LED panel.

[Here is the slide deck](https://slides.com/yanigisawa/coffeebot3000/) from my PyOhio 2017 talk. Note, somehow the version of Coffeebot was reduced from 4000 to 3000 from 2016 to 2017... this must be some new coffee depreciation scheme.
