## About

I am a software developer living in Indianapolis, Indiana. I have 10 years
of experience working in .NET, specifically writing C# applications. I started writing Python
code in my spare time starting in 2010, when I bought my first [Macbook Pro]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2010-11-04-macbook-pro %}).
Since 2017, I have been writing Python Apps professionally,
and am part of our Cloud Services Team, specializing in supporting Amazon
Web Services infrastructure.

Since 2011, my wife and I have taken Ballroom dancing lessons. The studio
we attend has events throughout the year that we participate in, and some
of the videos we have taken can be found on this site and on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/yanigisawa).

## About This Site
**Web host** [Dreamhost](http://www.dreamhost.com)

**Blog Software** [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) The website is generated using the Jekyll
framework, with the [{ Personal }](https://github.com/PanosSakkos/personal-jekyll-theme) Theme.
I migrated my blog to Jekyll for several reasons:

1. To update the design of my site to something more modern
2. To decrease the load time of my site by using a generated static HTML site
3. I wanted a site that would be more of a landing page for me, but with the ability to
add blog content, rather than being all about the blog, like my previous site was.

## FAQ
**Q:** How do you pronounce 'yanigisawa'?

**A:** Just how it's spelled. Really, does it
matter how one says it? Just shorten it to "yani" if you want to refer to it
verbally. (though, I don't know why you would want to, "James" is easier to
say) The background for this nickname I use on twitter and around the web is
that in High School, I played a [Yanagisawa](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;hs=8nI&amp;ei=LXUlS97AE8j-nAfBlNjwCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=spell&amp;resnum=0&amp;ct=result&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CBAQBSgA&amp;q=yanagisawa&amp;spell=1) brand of saxophone.
My senior year, I started taking lessons from a college professor at Indiana State University,
that was amused by the name, and said it really fast, like the [Micromachines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzbUPfoveok) guy.
This amused me more than the actual name did. Later when I needed to find a
unique name to create an email account (hotmail), I got frustrated trying to use my real
name (since mine is so common, most derivations on it were taken), and refused to append a number, (e.g. jalexander1234) as this just seemed
cheesy to me. So, I remembered "yanigisawa" and it has been a unique name for
me everywhere I go on the net.

**Q:** Why are you blogging?

**A:** [Mostly just for kicks](/blog/content/hello-world)
I'm following advice from an [An episode of Pragmatic Programmers](http://www.pragprog.com/podcasts/show/26)
and [Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/SocialNetworkingForDevelopersConferenceTalkVideo.aspx)
who both say that all software developers should have a blog,
an on-line presence, and gasp, a **personal brand.** I don't know
about the whole personal branding idea, but having an on-line presence has
allowed me to generate content that have helped others, and myself reference
problems I have solved in the past.
